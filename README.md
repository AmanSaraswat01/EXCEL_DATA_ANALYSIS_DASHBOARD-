# Vrinda Sales Analysis Excel Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data for Vrinda, a company that sells various products. The project involves data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, and the creation of a dashboard with insights.

## Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning phase, the following steps were performed:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Correcting inconsistencies
- Create new columns like age group and months using nested if and text formula
  
## Data Processing
In the data processing phase, the following actions were taken:
- Aggregating sales data by various categories (gender, state, age group, channel)
- Calculating the percentage contribution of each category to the overall sales

## Data Analysis and Insights
Based on the processed data, the following insights were derived:

1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men, accounting for 64% of total sales.
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top three states contributing to 35% of total sales.
3. The adult age group (20-45 years) has the highest contribution (~50%) to the sales.
4. Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels are the major contributors, accounting for approximately 80% of total sales.

## Dashboard
A dashboard was created to visualize the analyzed data and provide a quick overview of the insights mentioned above. The dashboard includes interactive charts, graphs, and tables to facilitate easy interpretation of the sales analysis.

## Future Improvements
Some potential areas for further improvement in this project include:
- Incorporating more advanced data visualization techniques
- Exploring additional dimensions for analysis (e.g., product categories, customer segments)
- Conducting a deeper analysis of the sales trends over time
